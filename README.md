# Projeto Test

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Journey CLI](https://github.com/stone-payments/journey-cli)** ✨

## Generating modules

To generate new modules following the [MicroFrontend RFC](https://mundipagg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INP/pages/5975049483/RFC+Arquitetura+Modular+MicroFrontend), use the `generate` command:

```
journey generate <module-type> <module-name>
```

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.
